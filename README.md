# Project Overview

Welcome to my Titanic Machine Learning project! Here, I harness machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. My focus is on understanding the factors that influenced survival chances using passenger data—such as names, ages, genders, socio-economic classes, and more.

This project consists of four steps:

1. **Define and Analyze**: I start by defining the problem and delving into dataset analysis. This phase provides me with insights into the nuances and intricacies of the data.

2. **Refine Data**: Armed with analysis insights, I clean and engineer features, transforming raw data into a polished foundation.

3. **Select a Model**: I evaluate various algorithms, choosing the best fit for our unique dataset. Among the contenders, I select the most promising one.

4. **Finalize Prediction**: With my chosen algorithm, the spotlight falls on the Random Forest Classifier—a predictive marvel. It not only makes precise predictions but also yields a performance score, showcasing its power.

Throughout this project, my goal is to unearth Titanic survival secrets while equipping myself with vital data analysis, pre-processing, algorithm assessment, and model deployment skills.
